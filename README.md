#### I needed a Zsh + i3-gaps + i3blocks config that was beautiful and functional as well as lightweight and CLI focused. 
But I was struggling to find a Zsh theme and configs that had what I was looking for so I made my own Zsh theme using Powerlevel9k!

I then wrote my own i3-gaps and i3blocks configs to look gorgeous while making my workflow smoother.

I'm including some screenshots on this repo and a list of dependencies in case you want to clone/fork my config :)

##### For the Shell:
0. [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) (Just kidding any distro is fine, but Arch is the best!).
1. [Zsh](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh) the most powerful shell out there!
2. [Powerlevel9k](https://github.com/bhilburn/powerlevel9k) the most awesome Powerline theme for ZSH around! (dependency for the Zsh theme I made)
3. acpi (To monitor the battery status).
4. [neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch) a fast, highly customizable system info script.
5. [Nerd Fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) patched fonts (I use Source Code Pro).

##### For the window manager:
1. [i3-gaps](https://github.com/Airblader/i3) i3wm with more features.
2. [i3blocks](https://github.com/vivien/i3blocks) a replacement for the default i3status with more features.
3. [Nerd Fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) patched fonts (I use Source Code Pro).
4. [Rofi](https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi) a window switcher, application launcher and dmenu replacement.
6. [Compton](https://github.com/chjj/compton) a compositor for X, to get window transparency and avoid tearing and vsync issues.
7. [Playerctl](https://github.com/acrisci/playerctl) to display current song on i3blocks.
3. [Feh](https://github.com/derf/feh) to set random wallpapers that change every minute with a systemd timer.

###### Optional but highly recommended:
1. xfce4-power-manager (Simple way to monitor battery status)
2. xfce4-notifyd (Helpful to get GTK notifications like current song or battery status)

### I ❤ i3 tiling capabilities:

### Zsh is the best:
![Zsh Features](https://github.com/da-edra/dotfiles/blob/master/.zsh-features.png)

### My [Rofi](https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi) theme:
##### Displays unobtrusively at the top and allows you to quickly launch applications (even CLI!) or switch within windows.
###### My theme and config are included in this repo inside .config/rofi/
![Application launcher](https://github.com/da-edra/dotfiles/blob/master/.rofi-drun.png)
![Window switcher](https://github.com/da-edra/dotfiles/blob/master/.rofi-window.png)

### [Spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs) rules! 
##### The best editor is neither Emacs nor Vim, it's Emacs *and* Vim!

### Having fun with the Mandelbrot Set
##### Mathematics is astonishingly beautiful but it can be even more beautiful when you're drawing CLI fractals with your Shell!
